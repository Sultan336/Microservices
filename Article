Overview:
Technology in this modern era is consuming resources(smartphones, laptops,smart gadgets), at an alarming rate. as with the rising
complexity of software development, new applications being developed every day along with additional features being integrated into them.
It is necessary that thses 'resources' should be used in an efficient manner.

So, what do i mean by the tearm 'resources'?

well, a lot applications run a a backend server which is often called the "cloud".There are several advantages in embracing the cloud, but
in essence they typically fall in two categories: either operational (flexibility / speed) or economical (costs) reasons.[2]

Tech giants (twitter, anazom, netflix, e-bay..) are getting creative with there software deployment techniques.
There are many ways a software can be depolyed and each way has it's own ups and downs. One popular technique is Microservices.

What is Micro-Services?

As the name suggests, it is the deployment of a large chunk of software into smaller pieces.
In other words it's a small application that can be:

1) Deployed independently 
2) Scaled independently
3) Tested independently 
4) Has a single responsibility [1]
