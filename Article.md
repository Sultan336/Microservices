# Overview:
Technology in this modern era is consuming resources(smartphones, laptops,smart gadgets), at an alarming rate. As with the rising complexity of software development, new applications being developed every day along with additional features being integrated into them. It is necessary that thses 'resources' should be used in an efficient manner.

## So, what do i mean by the tearm 'resources'?

well, a lot applications run a a backend server which is often called the "cloud".There are several advantages in embracing the cloud, but in essence they typically fall in two categories: either operational (flexibility / speed) or economical (costs) reasons.[2]

Tech giants (twitter, anazom, netflix, e-bay..) are getting creative with there software deployment techniques.
There are many ways a software can be depolyed and each way has it's own ups and downs. One popular technique is Microservices or the microservices architecture.

## What are Micro-Services?

As the name suggests,It is the development of a large chunk of software (i.e. Service) into smaller pieces.
So that each service can then be tweaked, developed, and deployed on it's own.  

__In other words it's a small application that can be:__

1. Scaled independently 
2. Tested independently
3. Deployed independently 
4. Has a single responsibility [1]

## Are mocroservices important?

Well, it depends on the complexity of an application. As the higher the complexity higher the likehood that it will
be developed using Microservices.

__Before microservices, monolithic was the was to go, However it lacked in the following ways:__

1) Lack of flexibility (i.e. Build using a single technology)
2) Unreliability       (i.e. Whole system collapses due to the failure of a single unit)
3) Non-Scalability     (i.e. Applications coundn't be easily scaled since the entire system would need to be rebuilt)
4) Interdependency     (i.e. Developers lackd independence)
5) Development pace    (i.e. Development of an application takes a lot of time) 

## How is Microservices better than the monolithic architecture?

__The Microservice architecture overcomes the monolithic architecture in the following ways:__

1) Multiple components
2) Logical Functionality Boundries 
3) Easy Routing
4) Decentralized
5) Fail-proof
6) Evolutionary
